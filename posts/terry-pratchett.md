Terry Pratchett is dead, so you may have heard. This is not new information (Pratchett died two years ago now, on 12 March 2015). Nor was is it much of surprise, having been diagnosed with Alzheimer's for many years before that. So why am I writing about him now? Well, I finally got round to reading The Shepherd's Crown, his last ever book.

Pratchett came out of the 80s, out of the golden age of British fantasy. It was a time when awkward teenagers would thumb through Fighting Fantasy books, hang around Warhammer stores and, of course, read Discworld books. These things were big business, a strange plane orthogonal to the (slightly more conventional) fantasy scene in the States. British fantasy was dirty and grim, introspective and self-contained where US fantasy was clean and fun, 

That age, however, is now completely gone: computers made Fighting Fantasy obsolete, Warhammer struggle to remain on highstreets and there will be no more Discworld novels.

In retrospect I'm not sure Pratchett was a great writer, but he achieved something most fantasy writers would envy: not just his own living, breathing world but, really, his own, complete genre. With its recurring characters (and recurring jokes) the Discworld - despite being flat - curls in on itself. Discworld is a filthy city, a crooked witch's cottage and a... . It was a fine place for an awkward teenager to crawl into and hide from the world.
